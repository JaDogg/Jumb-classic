<p class="fl">"If you love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray the Father and He shall give you another Comforter that he may abide with you forever." - John 14:15-16</p>
<p class="fl2">Muslim theologians have said that "another Comforter" is Muhammad, the Messenger of Allâh; and him to "abide forever" means the perpetuity of his laws and way of life (<i>Shari'ah</i>) and the Book (Qur'ân) which was revealed to him.</p>
<p>"But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me: And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning." - John 15:26-27</p>
<p>"But now I go my way to Him that sent me and none of you asketh me 'Whither goest thou?' But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart. Nevertheless I tell you the truth; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and approve righteousness and judgement." - John 16:5-8</p>
<p>"I have yet many things to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now. How be it when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak; and he will shew you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and he shall shew it unto you." - John 16:12-14</p>
<p>"A little while and ye shall not see me: and again a little while, ye shall see me, because I go to the Father." - John 16:16</p>
<p class="fl2">Muslim theologians have stated that the person who is described by Jesus to come after him - in the above verses - does not comply with any other person but Muhammad (peace be upon him) the Messenger of Allâh. This 'person' whom Jesus prophesied will come after him is called in the Bible 'Parqaleeta' This word was deleted by later interpreters and translators and changed at times to 'Spirit of Truth', and at other times, to 'Comforter' and sometimes to 'Holy Spirit'. The original word is Greek and its meaning is 'one whom people praise exceedingly.' The sense of the word is applicable to the word 'Muhammad' (in Arabic).</p>
