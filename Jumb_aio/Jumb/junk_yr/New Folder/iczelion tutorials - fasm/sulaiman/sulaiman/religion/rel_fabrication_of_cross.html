<ol>
        <li>The Bible testifies to the fact that Jesus was known among the Jews; he used to preach and deliver sermons in the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem. It was therefore, unnecessary to hire a Jew for thirty pieces of silver to direct them to him as related in Matthew.
        <li>It is related that one of the twelve disciples named Judas Iscariot was hired to direct the Jews to Jesus. They then sentenced him after which Judas was greatly ashamed and dissociated himself from their act and then committed suicide. All this took place within twenty four hours. The contradictions are obvious.
        <li><span class="fl2">The clearest proof which alone is sufficient to discredit this story is when the Jews passed the sentence of death against Jesus and intended to get the approval of the governor, Pontius Pilate.</span><br><br>
        <span class="fl">"And Jesus stood before the governor: The governor asked him, saying 'Art thou the king of the Jews!' And Jesus said unto him, 'Thou sayest': And when he was accused of (by) the chief priests and elders he answered nothing. Then said Pilate unto him, 'Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?' And he answered him never (to) a word..." - Matthew 27:11-14.</span><br>
        <p class="fl2">The Christians will interpret the above verse to mean that Jesus wanted to die on the Cross for the redemption of mankind and for the forgiveness of their sins. If so, then why did he ask to turn away that cup from him (i.e. death)? Why did he cry out while on the Cross (as they assume): "O Lord, why hast Thou forsaken me?" How could he have remained silent when the truth was being challenged? He was known for his soul-inspiring sermons challenging the learned Jewish <i>Rabbis</i>. No sane person can believe in this. If the story of the Cross is disproved then the very foundation on which Christianity is based, will be demolished.</p>
        <p>Muslims believe that Jesus was not crucified by the Jews as revealed in the Holy Qur'ân by Allâh in a crystal clear manner: V. 4:157,158.</p>
        <p>"And because of their saying (in boast): 'We killed Messiah Jesus, son of Mary, the Messenger of Allâh'; - but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but the resemblance of Jesus was put over another man (and they killed that man), and those who differ therein are full of doubts. They have no (certain) knowledge, they follow nothing but conjecture. For surely, they killed him not (i.e., Jesus, son of Mary). But Allâh raised him (Jesus) up (with his body and soul) unto Himself (and he PBUH is in the heavens).. And Allâh is Ever All-Powerful, All Wise."</p>
        <p class="fl2">The Jews themselves, together with the entire Christian world, believe that he was crucified. As proofs against their views and to prove the truth of the Muslim verdict through the Bible, I prepared the following set of questions based on the Book of Matthew in the New Testament of the Bible. (Chapters 26 and 27):</p>
        <ol>
	        <li>
		        <div class="fl">Did those who captured Jesus (according to their assumption) know him in person? or did they not know him?</div>
			Matthew testifies that they did not know him.<br><br>
	        <li>
		        <div class="fl">Was it during the day or night that he was captured?</div>
			Matthew says - it was during the night<br><br>
	        <li>
		        <div class="fl">Who was the one that directed them to him?</div>
			Matthew says: He was one of his twelve disciples called Judas Iscariot<br><br>
	        <li>
		        <div class="fl">Did he direct them free of charge or for a fixed reward which they specified, for him?</div>
			Matthew says: He directed them to him for a fixed reward of thirty pieces of silver<br><br>
	        <li>
		        <div class="fl">What was the condition of Jesus during that night?</div>
			Matthew says: He was fearful and prostrated in prayer saying: "O God, if it is possible for You to let this cup pass from me, then let is pass." It is incredible that such words could come from a believer in God, let alone a Prophet of God, because all believers believe that God has power over all things.<br><br>
	        <li>
		        <div class="fl">What was the condition of his eleven disciples?</div>
			Matthew says: Sleep overcame them that night together with their teacher (according to their assumption) out of fear.<br><br>
	        <li>
		        <div class="fl">Was Jesus contented with their condition?</div>
		        <span class="fl">Matthew says (verse 40-46): He was not satisfied. He used to come to them to wake them up saying: "Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak." Then he would come again to find them asleep and he would again wake them up and say the same thing. This weakness could not have been spoken of righteous pupils even if they were pupils of an ordinary pious teacher, let alone the disciples of Jesus, son of Mary.</span><br><br>
	        <li>
		        <div class="fl">Did they help him when those ruffians captured him?</div>
			Matthew says: They forsook him and fled.<br><br>
	        <li>
		        <div class="fl">Did Jesus have confidence in his disciples that night?</div>
			Matthew says: Jesus informed them that they will all forsake him. Then Jesus said unto them: "Verily, I say unto thee that this night before the cock crows, thou shall deny me - thrice." Peter said unto him, "Although I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee." Likewise also said all the disciples. And so it happened.<br><br>
	        <li>
		        <div class="fl">How did those ruffians capture him?</div>
			Matthew says: They came to him with swords and staves after they were directed to him by a Jew, then they captured him as described in verse 57:<br>
		        <p class="fl">"And they that had laid host on Jesus, led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the elders were assembled."</p>
			There they passed the sentence of death on him. The ruffians then took him away, spat on his face and struck him with their hands after which they stripped him of his clothes and clad him in scarlet robes, the placed a crown of thorns on his head and took him about, teasing and mocking him. They said to him: 'You are the king of Israel according to your claim.' They severely degraded him.
		        <br><br>
	        <li>
		        <div class="fl">Who finally decided to pass the death sentence against him?</div>
			Matthew says: He was Pontius Pilate, who was at the time that governor of Palestine.
		        <br><br>
	        <li>
		        <div class="fl">When the ruffians brought that man before the governor and informed him that the priest of the Jews passed the sentence of death by crucifixion according to their law (Torah), did he believe in them without investigation?</div>
		        <p class="fl">Matthew says: He did not believe them but asked that man: "Is it true what they have said?" He remained silent. The question was repeated and he continued to remain silent. He remained silent in view of the truth; it was essential for him even if he was not a Prophet to clarify the truth and deny the false accusation of the Jews. The governor's wife went to the governor and she said to him: "Have thou nothing to do with that just man? for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him."</p>
		        <p class="fl">The Bible states that Jesus delivered lengthy speeches to the Jews rebuking and warning them which amounted to defaming them. Then why was he silent that day? The governor's intention for asking him was to stand for the truth.</p>
	        <li>
		        <div class="fl">How was he crucified according to their assumption?</div>
		        <p>Matthew says: They crucified him between two thieves both of whom abused him by saying to him, "If you are truthful then save yourself."</p>
	        <li>
		        <div class="fl">This was a great calamity. What did he say while on the cross (according to their assumption)?</div>
		        <p class="fl">Matthew says (27:46):<br>
			Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, Iama sabachthani? (that is to say,) my God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?"
			This is a blatant declaration of disbelief according to all theological authorities. Whoever relates it to a Prophet is a disbeliever according to the revealed religions.</p>
        </ol>
</ol>
<p>Almighty Allâh, in the Qur'ân warns, the Jews and the Christians against their blasphemy; that Jesus is an incarnation of God (Allâh) or the son of God (Allâh) or in rejecting him totally; and that they must believe in him as a Messenger of Allâh only:</p>
<div class="fl3">"And there is none of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) but must believe in him (Jesus, son of Mary, as only a Messenger of Allâh and a human being) before him (Jesus BPUH or a Jew's or a Christian's) death (at the time of the appearance of the angel of death). And on the Day of Resurrection, he (Jesus) will be a witness against them." - (V.4:159)</div>
