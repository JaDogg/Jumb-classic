<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>All praise is to the One to Whom all Dignity, Honour and Glory are due; the Unique with perfect attributes, Who begets not, not is He begotten. He has no equal but He is the Almighty, Omnipotent. He sent His Messengers and Prophets to guide humanity towards monotheism; to worhop Him Alone, the only One Worthy of worship, and to warn them of the eternal dire consequences of polytheism, associating partners with One All‚h and the worship of creatures.</p>
<p>Peace and Blessings of All‚h be upon all the Prophets and Messengers, especially on Muhammad, the last of the Prophets, and on all who follow him in righteousness until the Day of Recompense.</p>
<br>

<b>JESUS AND THE DEVIL IN THE BIBLE</b>
<p>In the New Testament of the Bible, in the fourth chapter of the Gospel according to Matthew, the sixth and seventh verses cleary indicate that Jesus is an obedient mortal and God is the Master and Lord according to his saying in the seventh verse:</p>
<p class="fl">"It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord, thy God."</p>
<p>In this chapter we read that the Devil actually carried the Messiah, and took him from place to place. How can the Devil carry God? Glory be to All‚h; He is above such blasphemy!</p>
<p>Then the Devil orders him to prostrate before him and worship him, even tempting him with worldly possessions. How can the Devil even dare such an audacity with God? When the Devil wanted Jesus to comply with his orders, he (Jesus) replied by saying that it was written (in the previous Books):</p>
<p class="fl">"Thou shalt worship the Lord, thy God; And Him only shalt thou serve." - Matthew 4:10.</p>
<br>

<b>CHILDREN OF GOD</b>
<p>Jesus never called himself <i>Son of God</i> as far as I know - but he used to call himself the 'Son of Man' (Mark 2:10) although he heard himself being called by that name he did not object - as assumed in the Bible - and did not consider the title exclusively for him.</p>
<p>According to the Biblical term in the Old and New Testaments, every God-fearing righteous person is called 'Son of God'. In Matthew 5:9 we read:</p>
<p class="fl">"Blessed are the peace-makers, for they shall be called the children of God." - Matthew 5:9</p>
<p class="fl">"That ye may be children of your Father which is in heaven ..." - Matthew 5:45</p>
<br>

<b>GOD THE FATHER</b>
<p class="fl">"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." - Matthew 5:48</p>
<p class="fl">"... otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven." - Matthew 6:1</p>
<p class="fl">"Not every one that sayeth unto me (Jesus), Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven: but he that doeth the will of my Father, which is in heaven." - Matthew 7:21</p>
<p><b>N.B.</b> The word 'Lord' here was translated as <i>Rabb</i> in the Arabic version of the Bible so that people may be convinced that Jesus is God! But if one studies the rest of the verse, one will note that the verse bears testimony to the subservience (to God's Will) of the Messiah (Jesus). Therefore the correct translation should be:</p>
<p>"Not every one that sayeth to me, O my Master, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven."</p>
<p>It is obvious from the above readings from the Bible that the term 'Father' is used for God in numerous places in the Bible. It is never used exclusively for Jesus.</p>
<p class="fl">"At that time Jesus answered and said, 'I thank Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes.'" - Matthew 11:25</p>
<br>

<b>JESUS THE WORSHIPPER</b>
<p class="fl">"And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray ..." - Matthew 14:23</p>
<p class="fl2">I say: If Jesus is God or a part of God then why did he pray? In fact, prayer is always from a submitting, needy and dependent one for the Mercy of Almighty All‚h as mentioned in the Qur'‚n:</p>
<p>"O mankind! it is you who stand in need of All‚h but All‚h is Rich (Free of all wants and needs), Worthy of all praise" - (V.35:15)</p>
<p>"There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the Most Gracious (All‚h) as a slave." - (V.19:93)</p>
<br>

<b>A BIBLICAL STORY</b>
<p>"And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts and cried unto him, saying, 'Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David: my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.' But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying; 'Send her away, for she crieth after us.' But he answered and said, 'I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.'<br><br>
Then came she and worshipped him, saying, 'Lord, help me.' But he answered and said, 'It is not meet to take the children's bread and to cast it to dogs.'<br><br>
And she said, 'Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.'<br><br>
Then Jesus answered and said unto her, 'O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that every hour.'" - Matthew 15:22-28
<br><br>
In this story about a woman from Canaan there are noteworhty points:</p>
<ol><li/>Lack of mercy and love charged against Jesus (if the incident is reported correctly).
<li/>Degraded discrimination in regard to the uplifting of his tribe and not for the others.
<li/>Tribal pride of descendance and prejudice against others and calling them dogs.
<li/>An ignorant polytheist woman debated with him and won him over.
</ol>

<b>JESUS: A PROPHET OF ALL‚H.</b>
<p class="fl">"And behold, one came and said unto him, 'Good master, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?' And he said unto him, 'Why callest thou me good? (There is) none good but one, (i.e.) God, but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.'" - Matthew 19:16-17<p>
<p>In the above verses we note this acknowledgment of his submissiveness (to All‚h's Will).</p>
<p class="fl">"And when the chief priests and pharisees had heard his parable, they perceived that he spoke of them. But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude because they took him for a Prophet." - Matthew 21:45-46</p>
<p class="fl2">Here it is proved that all those who believed in Jesus during his life-time did not believe in him being God or the Son of God or one in the doctrine of Trinity; but they believed in him as being a Prophet only. This is indeed one of the strongest points of evidence against those who believe in the Divinity of Jesus (Incarnation of God) if only they pondered.</p>
<br>

<b>JESUS: A SERVANT OF ALL‚H.</b>
<p class="fl">"But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your master, even Jesus, and all ye are brethern." - Matthew 23:8</p>
<p class="fl2">Here it is cleary proved that Jesus was servant of All‚h, and that there is only One Master and He is All‚h. In the arabic version of the Bible this verse has been translated so that Jesus is meant to be the master whereas the English rendering is nearer the original sense.</p>
<p>"And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father which is in heaven" - Matthew 23:9</p>
<p>For this you will note that fatherhood and sonship is meant to be the relationship between the Lord and His servants: it is meant in a general sense and not specifically for Jesus.</p>
<p class="fl">"But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only." - Matthew 24:36</p>
<p class="fl2">This is a definite proof that the Final Hour is unknown to any but All‚h, thus Jesus's knowledge is imperfect like all other men; All‚h Alone is All-Knowing, Omniscient.</p>
<p class="fl">"And he (Jesus) went a little farther, and fell on his face and prayed, saying, 'O my Father, if it be possible, let his cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt.'" - Matthew 26:39</p>
<p class="fl2">We note here that the person speaking is unaware of All‚h's Will and realizes the fact that he is a servant of All‚h. He (All‚h) Alone can cause the change.</p>
<br>

<b>THE COMPILATION OF THE BIBLE</b>
<p>"And they took counsel and bought with them the potter's field to bury strangers in. Wherefore that field was called the Field of Blood, unto this day." - Matthew 27:7-8</p>
<p>From these verses we understand that the Bible (the New Testament) was not written during Jesus' life-time but long after the occurrence of the events described, having been retained in the memory of the people.</p>
<p class="fl">"And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, 'Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? (My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken me?)'" - Matthew 27:46</p>
<p class="fl2">This is according to their (Christians') assumption that Jesus cried in a loud voice saying the above words while he was being crucified. This is a great insult as such words could only come from unbelievers in All‚h. Further, it is incredible that such words should come out from a Prophet of All‚h because All‚h never breaks His Promise and His Prophets never compalined against His Promise.</p>
<br>

<b>JESUS: PREACHER OF MONOTHEISM (<i>TAUHID</i>)</b>
<p class="fl">"And this is life eternal, that they might know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou has send." - John 17:3</p>
<p class="fl">"And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, 'Which is the first commandment of all?' And Jesus answered him: 'The first of all the commandments is; hear O Israel, the Lord thy God is One Lord: and thou shalt love the Lord, thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.'" - Mark 12:28-30</p>
<p class="fl">"And the scribe said unto him, 'Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is One God; and there is none other but He.'" - Mark 12:32</p>
<p>"... he (Jesus) said unto him, 'Thou art not far from the kingdom of God...'" - Mark 12:34</p>
<p class="fl2">In these verses, Jesus (peace be upon him) himself had testified that All‚h is the One God, there is none other than Him, and that whoever believes in His Oneness, he is near the Kingdom of All‚h. Therefore whoever associates partners with All‚h or believes in the Trinity is far away from the Kingdom of All‚h, and whoever is far away from the Kingdom of All‚h he is the enemy of All‚h.</p>
<p class="fl">"But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angles of the heaven, but my Father only." - Matthew 24:36</p>
<p class="fl2">I say: A similar text was quoted from Matthew which is exactly as proclaimed by the Qur'‚n in that none knows when the Hour will come except All‚h. This establishes the fact that Jesus was subservient to All‚h and that he had no share in Divinity: that he was an incarnation of God, was an innovation by the people of Canaan.</p>
<p class="fl">"Jesus said unto her, 'Mary'. She turned herself, and sayeth unto him, 'Rabboni', which is to say, Master, Jesus saith unto her, 'Touch me not: For I am not yet ascended unto my Father and your Father; and to my God and your God.' Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she has seen the Lord, and that He had spoken these things unto her." - John 20:16</p>
<p class="fl2">In the above narrative Jesus clearly testified that All‚h is his God and their God, making no difference between him and them in the worship of the One All‚h. Whoever believes that Jesus is God has indeed blasphemed against All‚h and betrayed Jesus and all the Prophets and Messengers of All‚h.</p>
