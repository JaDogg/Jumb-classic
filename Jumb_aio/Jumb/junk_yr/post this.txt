Hi friends I’m going to create a new compiler named ‘Jumb’


*Jumb has a ‘to native code’ compiler and Runtime DLL
--(Both currently written in freeBASIC) 
*Jumb has an easy and a new syntax (it is not BASIC, C, OR ASM)
*Support inline assembly
*Also Jumb will be an open source compiler
 And available only for windows


Currently I’ve started creating the compiler and runtime DLL myself
But I need help 
If you are interest in helping please post a reply here (please specify your email)


The source code and binaries will be released as soon as I got some help
And I and the helpers finish first beta version.



Help I need now
----------------
*FASM (used as the assembler, linker in Jumb)
*Writing the compiler
*Writing the runtime DLL
*and any other way you like


Help I will need later (after the first release)
-------------------------------------------------
*Launching the project (in sourceforge.net)
*Creating a forum
*Writing a help file



You will see a sample Jumb code and a screenshot of compiled app
(of the code posted here)
(Compiled Using Jumb as compiler and FASM as assembler, linker)



Thanks For reading this ;)
