cool site man i like the social thing and the registration is easy and fun
Website for home depot surveys. This survey should take approximately 5-10 minutes. and its fun
it says Sorry, the offer you clicked on is no longer available. We apologize for the inconvenience.
I thought I should update you the way our country is managed
presently by the Rajapaksa Royal Family. If you read the following lines you could
see to yourself the plight of the economy in the country. Wastage and
corruption is at a high rate. We need a change. The main man who completed
the war who is also THE MAN OF THE MATCH is a common candidate. We should support
him to eliminate family dandyism and check mate law and order and
corruption etc.
Please circulate to your friends and colleagues in Sri Lanka to use their
vote wisely at least this time. Read the attachment for you to come to a
conclusion how the chess board is arranged presently.
Thanks
The next calamity Sri lanka needs to eliminate is the politicians itself
who are sucking the blood and every penny from all Sri Lankans!
# The Bigest disaster is Rs. 96 million from Ranviru fund ( Api
wenuven - Api) using for Presidential elections.

# Fuel price??? 48.63 % is Tax.. where this money go?? Why didn't the
GOSL hold the Hedgin .. because Asantha de Mel is Mahinda's bro- in-law.

# Whole Rajapakse family is buying estates , mansions etc...

# Now they have masive shares of CEYLINCO group.

# They bought " SWARNAWAHINI"

* Mihin air …. lost 6 billion and then given another 3 billion to
satisfy the ego of politicians

* 40 ministers with colombo residences claim Rs 100,000/- housing
allowance and Rs 35,000 electricity/water allowance

* Foreign minister spends Rs 100 million on foreign trips

* Rs 90 million paid to Mr Thondaman to move to premises belonging
to workers congress

* Rs 100 million lost due to fraud at foreign employment ministry
and now poor workers asked to leave as no money to pay them ! But no one
is responsible!

* Rs 150 million spent on 22 presidential advisors. May be even the highest number for any President in the World...

* 20 ministers have exceeded the budget and asks for Rs 2.52 billion ( part of
over spent is to buy luxury vehicles)

* Govt. unable to account for Rs 1000 million from Maga-neguma
project

* SLT telecom loses Rs 324 million in a tender racket

* Airlanka catering loses Rs 9000 million last yr from a profit of
Rs 4000 million the previous year.


* Palaces for presidents family..

* Countrys biggest criminal is a minister.. and no wonder law and
order has gone to dogs


* After end of war on 17th May army stopped firing ammunition. The
average saving is Rs 5 Mln per day. Where has all the money gone? This saving
could have been passed to the poor man by reducing taxes and cost of
living.

This is a different mine-field which needs to be cleaned it once and
for all ? This is why we need a change. Can anyone deny these things?
